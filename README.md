This project is a fantasy football dashboard that provides in-depth analytics and visualizations for our Sleeper league. It's designed to run in a Docker container, automatically updating every hour to provide the latest stats and power rankings.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Power Rankings**: A weighted ranking system that evolves from projection-based to performance-based as the season progresses.
- **F-DVOA Ratings**: A DVOA-like metric to measure team performance against the league average, adjusted for opponent strength.
- **Weekly Analysis**: A detailed breakdown of the current week's projections and a season-long view of positional scoring averages.
- **Multi-Year History**: A dropdown menu to easily view and compare stats from the last three seasons.
- **Automated Updates**: The dashboard automatically fetches the latest data every hour, so you always have the most current information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/megacorvega/falcon-ff
    cd falcon-ff
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    The Docker container will handle this automatically, but if you want to run the script locally, you'll need to install the required packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Your `requirements.txt` file should contain:
    ```
    pandas
    plotly
    sleeperpy
    requests
    ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

This project is designed to be run with Docker Compose, which handles both the Python script and the web server.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

2.  **Run the services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3.  **View your dashboard:**
    Once the containers are running, you can access the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The project is split into two main services that are managed by Docker Compose:

-   **`updater`**: This service runs the main `app.py` script in a loop. It fetches the latest data from the Sleeper API, performs all the necessary calculations, and saves the output as JSON files. It then waits for an hour before running again.
-   **`webserver`**: This is a lightweight Nginx server that hosts the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files, as well as the JSON data files generated by the `updater`. When you visit the site, the JavaScript fetches the data from the JSON files and dynamically builds the tables and charts.
